# METU-CENG477

These are all of the material used for CENG477 class at 2020/2021 Fall at METU.

HW1: Implementation of a basic ray tracer that simulates the propagation of light in the real world.

HW2: Extension of the basic ray tracer in HW1 with texture mapping and transformations.

HW3: An OpenGL program to render a given scene.

HW4: An OpenGL program to render flat Earth model using vertex and fragment shaders to display a texture image as a height map to fly through the scene interactively by processing keyboard input.

To run the HW4, download the source code into a linux machine and

$ ./run.sh
